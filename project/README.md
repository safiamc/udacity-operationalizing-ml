##Operationalizing Machine Learning Final Project

In this project, I trained an image classifier with single and multi-instance training, deployed endpoints for real-time inference, 
created an EC2 instance to locally train a model, created a Lambda function to query an endpoint, configured its role, ran a successful test, 
and configured concurrency and auto-scaling for improved latency. The full writeup contains all the details, and screenshots are located in the Screenshots folder.
